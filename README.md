# `koopcore`: Learning LTI Predictors for Dynamical Systems using Koopman Kernels

`koocore` is a Python library designed for learning linear time-invariant (LTI) predictors of dynamical systems. 

Please note that `koopcore` is currently under highly active development and some parts might still be a work in progress while continuously add new features and improvements.
