## `koopcore`: Koopman Kernels for Learning Dynamical Systems from Trajectory Data
`koopcore` is a Python library designed for learning linear time-invariant (LTI) predictors of dynamical systems. 

Please note that `koopcore` is currently under highly active development and some parts might still be a work in progress as we continuously add new features and improvements.
