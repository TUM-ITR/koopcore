# `koopcore`: Koopman Kernels for Learning Dynamical Systems from Trajectory Data
`koopcore` is a Python library designed for learning linear time-invariant (LTI) predictors of dynamical systems. This library provides tools for fitting linear predictors with estimators based on Koopman Kernels.

Please note that `koopcore` is currently under highly active development and some parts might still be a work in progress as we continuously add new features and improvements.

## Installation
Create an environment and install koopcore as a local package.
```
python -m venv koopcore_env
source koopcore_env/bin/activate
pip install --find-links "https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html" -e .
```
## Experiments
Jupyter notebooks containing the experiments are placed in the [`experiments`](./experiments) directory.
## References
This repository contains an implementation of the paper:
